# Assembly_Routing_Generator
This project consists in the design and implementation of a python program, which describes a new assembled manufactured product, its components, relations and technical solutions used to maintain them together, and the function/role each component carries. Once the product is described, ideally, the program must be able to automatically compute a functional assembly routing.


This project requires Python 3.7, and the numpy,tkinter,xml,matplotlib and networkx libraries.
